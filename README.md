# Ethereum-wide Interoperability

Welcome to the L2 Interop repository under the Ethereum organization. This repository serves as the central hub for Ethereum-wide interoperability efforts, providing a single source of truth and collaboration space for all teams and contributors across the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Overview

Our repository is organized into two main areas:

- **docs/**: Contains high-level documentation, onboarding guides, roadmaps, meeting notes, and user-friendly reference material.
- **specs/**: Contains detailed technical specifications, standards, and protocol definitions.

Discussions and collaborations in this repository focus on delivering concrete results. Expected outputs include prototypes, implementation references, and contributions to protocol improvements (e.g., [EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs), [RIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs)) or proposals for new or existing standards (e.g., [ERCs](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs), [CAIPs](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs)).

## Getting Started

1. **System Properties**  
    The most important file of this repository is: [Properties](./PROPERTIES.md). It lists and explains the system properties that guide and constraint the current design. 

1. **Explore the Documentation**  
    Visit the [docs/](./docs/) directory for a comprehensive guide on the project, including architecture overviews and getting started instructions.

1. **Review the Specifications**  
    Check the [specs/](./specs/) directory for technical details, protocol specifications, and design decisions that underpin the interoperability efforts.

1. **Working Group Meeting Notes**  
    Check out the [meeting call notes](https://notes.ethereum.org/@rudolf/interop-all-notes/) to stay up to date on discussions.
