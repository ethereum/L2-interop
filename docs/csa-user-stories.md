# Chain-Specific Addresses: Users-Stories

This document outlines the user stories as a goal for implementing chain-specific addresses. These stories capture key use cases and acceptance criteria for both end-users and developers, and do not express an opinion on specific implementations.

**End-users** refers to those who consume the production release, and **developers** are those who integrate or build on top of it.

## End-User Stories

### US1: Basic Send to Another Chain

**As an end-user**:

I want to send asset to any address,regardless of which chain it is on.

**Rationale**: I should be able to send assets as easily as if everything was on a single chain.

> ðŸ“Œ
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
> - Wallet detects and shows the destination chain when address is provided.
> - Error prevention if sending to a non-existent account.
> - The chain-specific address should be clearly visualized.
> - Clear separation between source and destination chain.
> - Optional: Transfer method and costs are showed afterwards (Intents/Bridges).

### US2: Human-Readable Addresses Usage Across Chains

**As an end-user**:

I want to send assets using an human-readable address.

**Rationale**: I can avoid dealing with raw addresses.

> ðŸ“Œ
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
> - The Human-Readable address is resolved deterministically into a correct chain-specific addresses.
> - Validates the existence of resolved addresses.
> - Chain information is shown.
> - Optional: shows resolved address.

### US3: Support for Unknown Chains

**As an end-user**:

I want to send assets to addresses on chains that my wallet hasn't explicitly integrated with.

**Rationale**: I shouldn't be limited to only sending assets to chains that my wallet already knows about.

> ðŸ“Œ
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
>  - Validates the existence of the chain via an on-chain list of chain configs.
> - Fetch chain config and confirms compatibility.
> - Validates the existence of resolved addresses.
> - Shows confirmation with chain information.
> - Clearly indicates this is a new/unknown chain to the user.
> - Optional: Allows user to save chain for future use.

### US4: Send Asset Error Prevention

**As an end-user**:

I want to be warned if Iâ€™m sending to potentially inexistent chain or address.

**Rationale**: I can avoid losing funds.

> ðŸ“Œ
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
> - All US3 acceptance criteria apply here.
> - If account is not found, warn about non-existent account.
> - If chain is not found, warn about a non-existent destination chain.
> - Optional: If chain identifier is intuitively distinguishable, suggest correction and let the user decide whether to continue.

## Developer Stories

### DS1: Parsing and Validating Addresses

**As an wallet/dApp developer**:

I want a straightforward API to parse a chain-specific address (e.g., "chain:0x123...") and validate its correctness,
so that I can accept user inputs and avoid sending transactions to invalid or ambiguous destinations.

**Rationale**: I can reduce the risk of ambiguity and then error.

> ðŸ“Œ
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
> - There is libraries that accepts a chain-specific string and outputs a result (e.g., {`chainIdentifier`, `rawAddress`}).
> - Distinguishable for cases where the same address format is used (especially relevant in EVM)
> - confirm chain identifiers against a known registry.
