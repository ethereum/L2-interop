# Message Passing

As the Ethereum landscape evolves, passing valid messages between different L2s, L3s, and LXs becomes fundamental for interconnecting user activity across chains, moving liquidity, and unlocking multi-domain applications, among other reasons. The desire for standardized APIs has motivated the creation of various proposals, from simple interfaces to those that aim to accommodate recent (thus common) rollup flows.

## Existing Messaging Standards

These standards are meant to work between any blockchain. They are agnostic to how messages are verified or delivered, including any off-chain mechanisms.

### ERC-6170: Cross-Chain Messaging Interface

[ERC-6170](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-6170.md/) defines a basic, minimal interface to send (`sendMessage`) and receive (`receiveMessage`) arbitrary messages. This is considered one of the most simple standards.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant ContractA as IERC6170 (Chain A)
    participant Relayer as Off-Chain Relayer
    participant ContractB as IERC6170 (Chain B)
    participant Recipient

    User->>ContractA: sendMessage(chainId_, receiver_, message_, data_)
    ContractA->>ContractA: emit MessageSent(to, toChainId, message, extraData)
    Note over ContractA: Handling bridging <br/> logic off-chain
    ContractA->>Relayer: Off-chain bridging flow
    Relayer->>ContractB: receiveMessage(chainId_, sender_, message_, data_)
    Note over Relayer: chainId_ MUST be "A"
    ContractB->>ContractB: emit MessageReceived(from, fromChainId, message)
    ContractB->>Recipient: Deliver message contents
```

### ERC-7786: Cross-Chain Messaging Gateway

[ERC-7786](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/673) also proposes a minimal interface to send (`sendMessage`) and receive (`executeMessage`) arbitrary messages. It containts extensible attributes that can be adapted to multiple bridging protocol models, as it is intented to be proof-agnostic. It leverages CAIP-10 for sender/receiver addresses, and introduces an optional post-proccessing step for any custom logic, as well as a explicit definitions of roles for sending and executing messages.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant GatewaySource as IERC7786GatewaySource (Chain A)
    participant Relayer as Relayer / Post‑Processing
    participant GatewayDestination as Destination Gateway (Chain B)
    participant Receiver as IERC7786Receiver

    User->>GatewaySource: sendMessage(destinationChain, receiver, payload, attributes)
    GatewaySource->>GatewaySource: emit MessagePosted(outboxId, sender, receiver, payload, value, attributes)
    Note over Relayer: The post-processing or <br/> relaying step triggers eventually
    Relayer->>GatewayDestination: preReceive(parameters) "This is ONLY illustrative"
    GatewayDestination->>GatewayDestination: verify proof & parse message
    GatewayDestination->>Receiver: executeMessage(messageId, sourceChain, sender, payload, attributes)
    Receiver-->>GatewayDestination: returns IERC7786Receiver.executeMessage.selector
```

### ERC-7841: Cross-chain Message Format and Mailbox

[ERC-7841](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/766), similarly to ERC-7786, defines a standard message format (metadata + payload). Also conceives the existence of the Mailbox contract for storing/retrieving messages, allowing either push- or pull-based bridging (see `execute` implementation example), so the message might sit "in the mailbox" until bridging is proven or invoked.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant MailboxA as Mailbox (Chain A)
    participant Relayer as Off-Chain Relayer
    participant MailboxB as Mailbox (Chain B)
    participant Recipient

    User->>MailboxA: send(Metadata, payload)
    Note over User: "e.g. send(destChainId, destAddress...)"
    Note over MailboxA: Handling bridging <br/> logic off-chain
    MailboxA->>Relayer: Off-chain bridging flow

    Relayer->>MailboxB: populateInbox([Message], aux)
    MailboxB->>Recipient: recv(Metadata) → returns payload
```

### ERC-7854: Verification-independent Cross-Chain Messaging

[ERC-7854](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/817) defines a minimal interface that decouples the messaging functions from the underlying verification method. Introduces a "Interchain Security Modules" API as a way to isolate the verification of messages.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant MailboxA as Mailbox (Chain A)
    participant Relayer as Off-Chain Relayer
    participant MailboxB as Mailbox (Chain B)
    participant Recipient as IMessageRecipient

    User->>MailboxA: dispatch(destinationDomain, recipientAddress, body, customHookMetadata...)
    Note over MailboxA: Handling bridging <br/> logic off-chain
    MailboxA->>Relayer: Off-chain bridging flow

    Relayer->>MailboxB: process(_metadata, _message)
    MailboxB->>MailboxB: verify() with ISM
    MailboxB->>Recipient: handle(origin, sender, _message)
```

## External Messaging Protocols

Different protocols have been built to enable message passing across the chains they support. In principle, all of them function with their own security models and operate independently of the chains’ operations and governance. Most prioritize speed over canonical bridges, as they rely on some degree of confirmation subjectivity.

Note that actual implementations may choose to adopt existing standards or define their own interfaces.

### CCTP

[CCTP](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started) is a cross-chain protocol for transferring USDC between supported chains. It deploys the respective messenger contracts, where messages (burn and then mint) are orchestrated.

- **V1**: Establishes the `MessageTransmitter` by defining `sendMessage`, with destination, recipient, and `messageBody`, as well as the `receiveMessage` function. Users are able to self-relay. Senders can specify who is allowed to relay by using `sendMessageWithCaller`. Messages can be replaced before being received using `replaceMessage`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant SourceMessenger as MessageTransmitter (Chain A)
    participant AttestationService as CCTP Attestation Service
    participant Relayer as Off-Chain Relayer
    participant DestinationMessenger as MessageTransmitter (Chain B)
    participant Recipient as Recipient

    User->>SourceMessenger: sendMessage(destinationDomain, recipient, messageBody) <br/> or sendMessageWithCaller (...destinationCaller))
    SourceMessenger->>SourceMessenger: emit MessageSent(message)
    Note over SourceMessenger: "AttestationService" monitors <br/> chain finality
    AttestationService->>AttestationService: Signs message (off-chain)
    AttestationService->>Relayer: Provide attestation
    Relayer->>DestinationMessenger: receiveMessage(message, attestation)
    DestinationMessenger->>Recipient: Execute message contents
    DestinationMessenger->>DestinationMessenger: emit MessageReceived (caller, sourceDomain, nonce, sender, messageBody)

```

- **V2**: `MessageTransmitterV2` defines `sendMessage` similarly to V1, but adds `destinationCaller` as a default parameter and includes `finalityThresholdExecuted`. The `receiveMessage` function is adapted to support these new features. A `replace` function, as seen in V1, is not explicitly present in this version.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant SourceMessenger as MessageTransmitter (Chain A)
    participant AttestationService as CCTP Attestation Service
    participant Relayer as Off-Chain Relayer
    participant DestinationMessenger as MessageTransmitter (Chain B)
    participant Recipient as Recipient

    User->>SourceMessenger: sendMessage(destinationDomain, recipient, destinationCaller, messageBody, minFinalityThreshold)
    SourceMessenger->>SourceMessenger: emit MessageSent(message)
    Note over SourceMessenger: "AttestationService" monitors <br/> chain finality
    AttestationService->>AttestationService: Signs message (off-chain)
    AttestationService->>Relayer: Provide attestation
    Relayer->>DestinationMessenger: receiveMessage(message, attestation)
    DestinationMessenger->>Recipient: Execute message contents
    DestinationMessenger->>DestinationMessenger: emit MessageReceived (caller, sourceDomain, nonce, sender, finalityThresholdExecuted messageBody)

```

### LayerZero

[LayerZero](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/technical-reference/api) is a generic messaging protocol that deploys an `EndpointV2` on each chain. Users invoke `send` on the source endpoint, optionally paying fees in either native tokens or the `lzToken`. Off-chain relayers verify and transport the message to the destination chain, where the `verify` (under validation flow) and `lzReceive` calls deliver the payload to the intended receiver contract. Additional features include allowing delegated calls, clearing queued messages with `clear`, and customizing fee payments or message parameters via `MessagingParams`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant SourceEndpoint as EndpointV2 (Chain A)
    participant Relayer as Off-Chain Relayer
    participant DestinationEndpoint as EndpointV2 (Chain B)
    participant Receiver

    User->>SourceEndpoint: send(dstEid, receiver, message, options, payInLzToken)
    SourceEndpoint->>SourceEndpoint: emit PacketSent(encodedPayload, options, sendLibrary)
    Note over SourceEndpoint: Handling bridging <br/> logic off-chain
    SourceEndpoint->>Relayer: Provide message data to be delivered
    Note over Relayer,DestinationEndpoint: Validation flow
    Relayer->>DestinationEndpoint: lzReceive(origin, guid, message, executor, extraData)
    DestinationEndpoint->>DestinationEndpoint: emit PacketDelivered(origin, receiver)
    DestinationEndpoint->>Receiver: Deliver message contents
```


## Rollup Messaging Protocols

Some implement their own messaging protocols to interoperate with specific instances they choose and may also rely on.

### Linea

[Linea](https://docs.linea.build/technology/message-service) deploys the corresponding messenger contracts on both L1 and L2. The relayers (called Postbots) listen for calls made on either side and deliver them to the destination. All cross-chain messages pass through this service, which provides replay protection.

The `sendMessage` function includes the value, recipient, fee to pay, and calldata, while `claimMessage` adds the fee recipient and nonce on top of those. Manual claiming is always available, especially used when no fee is set to be paid. For both flows, messages must first be verified against `MessageManager`. Additionally, for L2→L1 transfers, `claimMessageWithProof` is used, which includes a Merkle proof for final verification.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant OriginService as L1 or L2 MessageService (Chain A)
    participant Relayer as PostBots/Off-chain Relayer
    participant DestinationService as L2 or L1 MessageService (Chain B)
    participant Recipient

    User->>OriginService: sendMessage(to, fee, calldata)
    OriginService->>OriginService: emit MessageSent(from, to, fee, value, nonce, calldata, messageHash)
    Note over OriginService: Bridging logic <br/> (L1 deposit or L2 withdrawal initiated)
    OriginService->>Relayer: Off-chain bridging or PostBots flow
    Note over Relayer: Validation flow
    Relayer->>DestinationService: claimMessage(from, to, fee, value, feeRecipient, calldata, nonce) <br/> or claimMessageWithProof(ClaimMessageWithProofParams params) 
    DestinationService->>DestinationService: emit MessageClaimed(messageHash)
    DestinationService->>Recipient: Deliver message contents
    DestinationService->>Relayer: receive fees (if it is allowed/set)

```

### OP Stack

OP Stack deploys corresponding messenger contracts on both L1 and L2, as well as L2-to-L2 when interoperability is enabled at the protocol level. All of them include replay protection.

- **[L1→L2 / L2→L1](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/messengers.html)**: This follows the `CrossDomainMessenger` library. The `sendMessage` function includes the target, value (in ETH), message data, and gas limit. The `relayMessage` function, in turn, includes the same parameters while adding the sender and nonce.
    - L1→L2 operates on a push-based model, where sequencers process deposits when deemed safe, strictly following the order in which they were initiated.
    - L2→L1 follows a pull-based model, where withdrawals are finalized asynchronously in practice, and executed through `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant OriginMessenger as L1 or L2 CrossDomainMessenger (Chain A)
    participant Relayer as Sequencer (L1 deposit) or Off-chain Relayer/User (L2 withdrawal)
    participant DestinationMessenger as L2 or L1 CrossDomainMessenger (Chain B)
    participant Recipient

    User->>OriginMessenger: sendMessage(to, minGasLimit, value, data)
    OriginMessenger->>OriginMessenger: emit SentMessage(target, sender, message, messageNonce, minGasLimit)
    OriginMessenger->>OriginMessenger: emit SentMessageExtension1(sender, value)
    Note over OriginMessenger: Bridging logic <br/> (L1 deposit or L2 withdrawal initiated)
    OriginMessenger->>Relayer: Off-chain proof of inclusion/finality reached
    Note over Relayer: Validation flow
    Relayer->>DestinationMessenger: relayMessage(nonce, sender, target, value, minGasLimit, message)
    DestinationMessenger->>DestinationMessenger: emit RelayedMessage(msgHash)
    DestinationMessenger->>Recipient: Execute message contents

```
- **[L2→L2](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/messaging.html)**: This has its own flow while still relying on the `sendMessage` and `relayMessage` concepts. Messages are sent directly from one L2 chain to another by specifying the destination chain ID, the target address, and the message payload. Once the message is validated via `CrossL2Inbox`, anyone can call `relayMessage` on the destination L2 by providing proof of the source event. This process remains asynchronous and can be finalized as soon as possible, depending on off-chain relayers and sequencers detecting and confirming initiated messages.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant OriginMessenger as L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger (Chain A)
    participant Relayer as Off-chain Relayer
    participant DestinationMessenger as L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger (Chain B)
    participant Recipient

    User->>OriginMessenger: sendMessage(destination, target, message)
    OriginMessenger->>OriginMessenger: emit SentMessage(destination, target, nonce, sender, message)
    Note over OriginMessenger: Bridging logic on Chain A <br/> (writes event to be proven)
    OriginMessenger->>Relayer: Off-chain proof or inclusion flow
    Note over Relayer: Validation and cross-chain proof
    Relayer->>DestinationMessenger: relayMessage(id, sentMessage)
    DestinationMessenger->>DestinationMessenger: Validate & decode SentMessage Payload
    DestinationMessenger->>DestinationMessenger: emit RelayedMessage(source, nonce, messageHash)
    DestinationMessenger->>Recipient: Execute message contents

```

### Scroll

[Scroll](https://docs.scroll.io/en/developers/l1-and-l2-bridging/the-scroll-messenger/) deploys messenger contracts on both L1 and L2. Cross-chain messages always go through these messengers, which provide replay protection.

The L1→L2 / L2→L1 flow follows the `ScrollMessengerBase` library. The `sendMessage` function includes the target, value (in ETH), message data, and gas limit. Both implementations define two `sendMessage` functions (one of them includes `refundAddress`; perhaps the refund mechanism is not actually implemented for withdrawals). The `relayMessage` function, in turn, includes the same parameters while also adding the sender and nonce.

- L1→L2 operates on a push-based model, where sequencers process deposits after they are included in the queue. The L1 contract also contains the `replayMessage` function, responsible for retrying or updating the gas for previously sent but skipped messages, and `dropMessage`, which allows the cancellation of a never-included message and the reclaiming of locked value.
- L2→L1 follows a pull-based model, where messages are finalized asynchronously. Messages are finalized by calling `relayMessageWithProof`, which requires a Merkle Proof.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant OriginMessenger as L1 or L2 ScrollMessenger (Origin)
    participant Relayer as Sequencer (L1 deposit) or Off-chain Relayer/User (L2 withdrawal)
    participant DestinationMessenger as L2 or L1 ScrollMessenger (Destination)
    participant Recipient

    User->>OriginMessenger: sendMessage(target, value, message, gasLimit) <br/> or sendMessage(target, value, message, gasLimit, refundAddress)
    OriginMessenger->>OriginMessenger: emit SentMessage(Sender, target, value, nonce, gasLimit, message)
    Note over OriginMessenger: Bridging logic <br/> (L1 deposit or L2 withdrawal initiated)
    OriginMessenger->>Relayer: Off-chain proof of inclusion/finality reached
    Note over Relayer: Validation flow
    Relayer->>DestinationMessenger: relayMessage(from, to, value, nonce, message) <br/> or relayMessageWithProof(..., proof)
    DestinationMessenger->>DestinationMessenger: emit RelayedMessage(messageHash)
    DestinationMessenger->>Recipient: Execute message contents

```

# Comparison
